# Time Pattern Engine v3.0

This engine detects and models time-based biological patterns (e.g., ECG, EEG) using deep learning (LSTM). It is capable of real-time visualization and prediction using multiple biosignals.

## ðŸ“¦ Features
- Multivariate LSTM predictor (ECG, EEG, HRV, etc.)
- Real-time signal dashboard via Streamlit
- Modular design for research and experimentation

## ðŸ›  Installation

### 1. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the real-time dashboard:
```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

## ðŸ’» Minimum Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- 8 GB RAM (16 GB recommended)
- CPU or GPU (optional)

## ðŸ”® Roadmap
- EEG integration
- Time-state classification
- Chronotherapeutic modeling
